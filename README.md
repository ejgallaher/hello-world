Practice for an opening web page.

I am just beginning to use GitHub. I have used git via the command line on the Mac, but
I want to learn how to interact with GitHub as well. 

I have spent quite a bit of time learning Python, although I am certainly still a noob. Along the way I carefully studied namespaces, functions, classes, and class methods, so I have a pretty clear (beginning) understanding of OOP.

I am currently taking a Udemy class, Web-Dev 2.0' from Rob Percival. I started a similar course about 2 years ago, but did not complete it. This is largely a review up to now, but there is some new material. One goal is create a web page that archives all the lessons as I work through them. I have done that for html, and I'm beginning the process for CSS and JScript.

Although I haven't read of anyone doing exactly this, it seems like a hyperlinked archive could be a great way of keeping a journal. There could be personal issues, diary entries, etc., but there could also be links to blog drafts, markdown, and coding exercises. Rather than trying to organize and retrieve everything via the Mac Finder (or Windows Explorer), it seems like brief descriptions, and links, could be kept in chronological order for quick access. Beyond that, links could be added for supporting materials from the work pages as well.
